# eNotes Bypass

I got tired of manually editing the HTML using the inspect tool everytime I went to the site. This Google Chrome extension automatically unblurs the answers on the site. You're welcome.

## Installation
This extension isn't on the Chrome Web Store, so you'll need to download it yourself. If the folder's zipped, unzip it. Once you have the folder:
1. Open Google Chrome
1. Click the three dots in the top right corner
1. Hover over "More Tools" in the dropdown
1. Click "Extensions" in the dropdown
1. Toggle developer mode in the top right corner
1. Press the "Load unpacked" button in the top left
1. Select the folder you just downloaded
1. Enjoy!
